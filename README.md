# cookiethief
Python has the http.cookiejar, which supposedly also works with the Mozilla cookies. It does not do it.
Firefox has already changed the cookie store before quite a few versions. From a text file to a sqlite database.

Hence this little cookie thief. He sneaks up and steals the Firefox, all cookies to put it in his own cookiejar.
